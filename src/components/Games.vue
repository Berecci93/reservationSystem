The player teams up with Captain Astro and goes on a quest to rescue his lost crew scattered across 5 worlds and 20 levels. In total, there are 213 Bots to rescue. In a VR space, the player uses their body to lean and see past obstacles or headbutt parts of the scenery. The DualShock 4 controller is used to control Astro, but exists within the VR space as a virtual gadget to help Astro on his way. The game counts 20 stages, 6 bosses, 26 challenge stages, and a collection room on board the Astro Ship."
